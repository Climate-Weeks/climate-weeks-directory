# Climate Weeks

Welcome to Climate Weeks! üåç This is a collaborative directory of climate action events happening around the world. Our goal is to help connect climate leaders, innovators, and concerned citizens with important climate events in their region.

## Contributing

We welcome and encourage contributions! Whether you're adding a new climate week, updating event details, or improving the codebase, your help makes this resource better for everyone.

### Adding or Updating Events

Events are stored in `src/data/climateWeeks.js`. To add a new event:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your event to the `climateWeeks` array following this format:

```javascript
{
  city: "City Name",
  slug: "city-name", // URL-friendly version of the city name
  eventName: "Event Name",
  website: "https://event-website.com",
  startDate: "YYYY-MM-DD", // If known
  endDate: "YYYY-MM-DD",   // If known
  months: ["Month"], // Array of months the event spans
  organizers: ["Organizer Name"],
  description: "A detailed description of the event...",
  imageUrl: "https://images.pexels.com/..." // Pexels image URL
}
```

If dates aren't confirmed yet, use:
```javascript
{
  // ... other fields ...
  isTBD: true,
  displayDate: "TBD (Month, YYYY)",
